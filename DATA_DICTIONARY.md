# Credit Risk Portfolio — Synthetic Dataset

5 interlinked tables covering **10,000 customers** and their loan accounts,
external credit history, repayment behavior, and collections activity.
All data is synthetically generated but designed to mimic realistic
distributions, correlations, and messiness found in real banking data.

## Table Overview

| `bureau_credit.csv` | 1 row per external credit line | ~23,000 | `customer_id` → customers |
| `repayment_history.csv` | 1 row per account per month | ~176,000 | `account_id` → loan_accounts |

## Notes for whoever is using this dataset
- **Known data quality issues are intentional**: missing values in several columns,
  inconsistent gender labels, missing interest rates/DPD values. A strong candidate
  should surface and handle these explicitly, not silently drop rows.
- Relationships are genuinely one-to-many (a customer can have multiple loan
  accounts; an account has many months of repayment history) — this requires
  real aggregation/feature-engineering before modeling, not just a single join.
- `customers.csv` supports **profiling/segmentation** independent of the
  credit risk model (e.g., income x region x employment cross-tabs), so it's
  usable for both the analytics and modeling stages of the exercise.
- Overall portfolio default rate is ~16%, with clear (but not trivial)
  signal from income, employment type, and prior bureau write-offs.
